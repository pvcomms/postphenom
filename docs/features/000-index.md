# Features

One feature, one file, `NNN-slug.md`. Numbers are allocated in creation order and never
reused or renumbered — the number is the permanent name of that work, so `niwa 001` still
means something in a year.

Frontmatter carries `title` and `status`. Status is one of `draft`, `next`, `building`,
`shipped`, `parked`. `~/work/capp/spine/bin/scan.py` reads only the frontmatter, and the first
feature in `building` → `next` → `draft` order becomes this project's next action on the
front door.

A feature is marked `shipped` only when its acceptance checks were actually run and passed.

The shape to copy: `~/work/capp/spine/docs/templates/feature.template.md`.
